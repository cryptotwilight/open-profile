# open-profile
This is the repository for the Open Profile Project. This project has been created to incept the beginning portable social media profiles. Today it is not possible to export the entirety of your social media profile from one platform to another. This means that things such as your networks, contacts groups etc, all get either obliterated or left behind when you leave a given network. 
Open Profile has been created using APE COIN and IPFS to create a new infrastructure for social media where your data and networks stay with you regardless the social media platform that you're using. 

APE COIN enables Open Profile to incept a two way mode of rewards. Today social media platforms provide limited ways in which you can reward your favourite content creators however they don't provide very good ways for content creators to reward their communities. 

Using APE COIN staking, Open Profile is able to provide profile owners with a way to directly reward those members of their community that they feel are making a difference moving us into an era of two way social media give and recieve. 

Open Profile also uses the content addressing features of IPFS to match shared content reducing duplication of shared content and increasing the level of unique content that is shared to a profile owner by their community. 

This creates a new space for social media content platforms that are predicated on unique media as opposed to perpetual reshares and content duplication as is evident on today's Web2 social media platforms.
